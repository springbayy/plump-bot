"""Multiprocess environment workers for rollout collection.

Workers own the Python-bound half of collection: engine stepping, observation
encoding, privileged targets, and heuristic opponents. Model inference stays
in the trainer process. Each wave, every worker sends one ``DecisionRequest``
per active episode blocked on a model action; the trainer batches forwards by
policy and replies with actions.

Only stdlib imports at module level — the heavy plump/torch imports happen
inside the spawned worker so the parent's GPU state is never touched here.
